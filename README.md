# MusicalAI - A Blog on Music and AI 

This is the repository with notebooks and complementary code referenced in the blog [MusicalAI](https://musicalai.substack.com/).

Each blog post is a Musing that is numbered so you can find the corresponding notebook for the Musing. E.g. [Musing #2](https://musicalai.substack.com/p/musing-2-ai-powered-lofi-bollywood) corresponds to `_2_musicgen.ipynb`. 

Each of the notebooks will also be available in Google Colab, so you can use the link at the top of the notebooks to open them in Colab.
